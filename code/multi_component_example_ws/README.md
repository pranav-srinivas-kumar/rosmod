Multi-Component Example:
========================

Description:
------------
This example shows a way of running multiple components inside a node in an object-oriented fashion.  Each component has its own component operation queue.  The code has been written and commented in such a way as to show which parts are generated each time, which parts are generated based on the model, and which parts much be written by the developer.  

Nodes:

NodeMain requires command line arguments:

	 nodeMain <node name>
