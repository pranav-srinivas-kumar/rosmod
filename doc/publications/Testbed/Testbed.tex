\section{The RCPS Testbed}

\subsection{Architecture}
require good physics integration -> distributed -> time sync -> low jitter -> accurate timing
what kind of tests can you run?
what kind of systems is this good for?
\subsubsection{Application Network and Emulation}
\subsubsection{Physics Network}
\subsubsection{Physics sim and interface}
\subsubsection{Actual hardware}

\subsection{System Analysis}
\subsubsection{Network Analysis}
\subsubsection{Timing Analysis}

\subsection{Experiments}
\subsubsection{Orbiter}
Good for certain types of system testing but not great for doing tests across multiple domains
\subsubsection{KSP}
Though not as accurate, allows testing between multiple interacting domains.

\subsection{Limitations}
can't do all integration testing
usb-ethernet -> limitation for physics possibly -> what scenarios
switches can be limitations depending on applications and such -> to what can they support?
processing limitations -> dependent on testbed -> hardware prototyping boards should be used for relevant hardware
how does the system/testbed scale: switches? openflow?

\subsection{Future Work/Extensions}
test/measure jitter
