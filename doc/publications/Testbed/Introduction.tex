\section{Introduction}

Distributed CPS are hard to develop hardware/software for; because the software is coupled with the hardware and the physical system, software testing and deployment may be difficult.  Many systems require rigorous testing before final deployment, but may not be able to be tested easily in the lab or may not be testable in the real world without first providing the assurances that the tests produce.  These types of systems must be tested for performance assurances, reliability, and fail-safety.  Examples of these systems include UAV/UUV systems, fractionated satellite clusters, and networks of autonomous vehicles, all of which require strict guarantees about not only the performance of the system, but also the reliability of the system.  Because of the need for such strict design-time guarantees, many traditional techniques for software testing cannot be used.  Cloud-based software testing may not accurately reflect the performance of the software, since many of these systems use specialized embedded computers, and furthermore does not provide the capability to easily integrate a system simulation into the software testing loop.  For such systems, a closed-loop simulation testbed is necessary which can fully emulate the deployed system, including the physical characteristics of the nodes, the network characteristics of the systems, and the sensors and actuators used by the systems.

use automotive industry testbed as example, this is cost effective version for other embedded systems developers and researchers
