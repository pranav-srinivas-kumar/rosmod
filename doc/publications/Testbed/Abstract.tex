\begin{abstract}
We have created a testbed for the development and testing of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) applications.  This testbed incorporates smart network hardware which allows for high-fidelity emulation of the system's network characteristics, and simulation systems which allow for high-fidelity simulation of the CPS, its environment, its sensors, and its actuators.  We discuss the architecture of this testbed, the types of experiments and applications which can be run on the testbed, some of the testbed's limitations, and some extensions to the testbed.
